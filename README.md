# Flutteryomi

A personal project for learning Flutter. An attempt to port Tachiyomi's UI and functionality to Flutter and its target platforms.

## Running Locally

```sh
flutter run --verbose --fast-start
```

## Todo

- Folder structure and conventions
- Feature parity with Tachiyomi
- Desktop layout
  - Browser-like tabs (?)
- Conditional Cupertino for iOS (?)
